                        I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour (Nijmegen, Netherlands) in Cognitive Robotics. As a member of the Synthetic, Perceptive, Emotive, and Cognitive Systems (SPECS) Lab, led by Paul Verschure, I aim to understand how complex systems self-regulate by generating goal-oriented autonomous behaviors. To do so, I adopt a convergent synthetic methodology where biologically-constrained computational models are designed and embedded in robots to simulate cognitive functioning and reproduce intelligent behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p class="m-4">
                        For cognitive robots to self-regulate, the accommodation of environmental demands and opportunities must be grounded on the interoceptive state of the self. To account for both the internal and the external milieu together with the individual’s actions that bridge both domains, I understand cognitive architectures as key. By guiding the structural organization of the different computational models and the self-regulatory principles they represent, cognitive architectures facilitate the hierarchical control of behaviors such as the reactive orchestration of existing internal needs, the prediction, and anticipation of future homeostatic errors, or the formation of a cognitive map that allocates state-dependent relevant stimuli (rewards).
                    </p>
                    <p class="m-4">
                        Understanding how living systems manage to ensure their fitness by self-regulating in a complex world has also strong implications for Artificial Intelligence and autonomous robot behavior. Some of my contributions to HORIZON 2020 EU projects can showcase the suitability of considering self-regulation in a robot industrial or clinical context. For instance, in HR-Recycler, collaborative robots disassembling WEEE material modulate their task, speed, or safety distance according to workers’ psychological preferences and physiological metrics. Or in ReHyb, a self-regulatory cognitive architecture allows stroke patients to individualize their neurorehabilitation training, meaning a serious rehabilitation game, an exoskeleton and a functional electrostimulation system match their parameters to the current cognitive and physical state of the user.

                    <p class="m-4">
                        My interest in understanding intelligence led me to study Psychology at the University of Granada. There, under the supervision of Julio Santiago, I had the opportunity to start my research activity by working on my bachelor’s thesis with the Grounded Cognition Lab. As a result of this fruitful collaboration, my thesis “Can our focus on the past put it in front of us?” was awarded with the “Best bachelor’s thesis” prize from the Official College of Psychology of Eastern Andalusia. Then, understanding the importance of technical skills in research, I moved to the Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona) to study for the Multidisciplinary Master in Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media. Was there that I had my first contact with Paul Verschure, and after attending the Barcelona Cognition, Brain, and Technology summer school organized by him, I joined the SPECS group. First as a research assistant and later as a predoctoral researcher, I have met many brilliant people in this group who have helped me grow and meet my research goals.

                        Today my education and training are still ongoing, but now I feel confident in both theoretical and technical areas. Indeed, between the technical skills I have developed to achieve the research goals of my Ph.D. project I can highlight:

                    <ul>
                      <li>Python programming for developing the computational models I embed into synthetic agents and analyzing the following results.</li>
                      <li>ROS middleware to real-time control complex physical robots.</li>
                      <li>Robot simulators such as Gazebo or Webots to carry out our experiments and prototype their future physical realization.</li>
                      <li>GIT to keep track of the changes in collaborative projects.</li>
